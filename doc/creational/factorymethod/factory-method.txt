- Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to
instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

- Also Known As
Virtual Constructor

- Applicability
Use the Factory Method pattern when
• a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
• a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
• classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you
want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.
