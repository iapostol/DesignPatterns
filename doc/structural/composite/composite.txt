- Intent
Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and allow clients to work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

Applicability
Use the Composite pattern when
• you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
• you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of
objects and individual objects.
Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.
