-Definition
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring
to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

The Mediator pattern prevents direct communications between individual components.

Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly,
and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

With the mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated within a mediator object.
Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator.
This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling.
