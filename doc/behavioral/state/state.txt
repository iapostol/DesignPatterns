Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
The State pattern suggests to create new classes for all possible states of a context object and to extract the state-related behaviors into these classes.

The context will contain a reference to a state object that represents its current state.
Instead of performing a behavior on its own, the context will delegate the execution to a state object.
